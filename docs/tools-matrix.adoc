=== Source Verification
Every tool listed has been systematically verified from:
* `libs/install-apt.sh` - APT package definitions
* `libs/install-snap.sh` - Snap package definitions
* `dot/.config/mise/config.toml` - Mise managed tools
* `libs/install-custom.sh` - Custom installations (LazyVim, JMC)
* `dot/.config/devbase/versions.yaml` - Version specifications

=== Conditional Installations
Some tools are installed conditionally based on the display server:
* **Wayland**: `wl-clipboard` is installed if Wayland display server is detected
* **X11**: `xclip` and `xsel` are installed if X11 display server is detected



=== Installation Methods Detail
* **apt**: System package manager (respects APT proxy configuration)
* **snap**: Snap package (respects snap proxy configuration)
* **snap/classic**: Snap package with classic confinement
* **mise/aqua**: Installed via mise using aqua backend (GitHub releases)
* **mise/ubi**: Installed via mise using ubi backend (Universal Binary Installer)
* **mise/native**: Installed via mise native backends (node, python, java, go, maven, jq)
* **mise/github**: Installed via mise directly from GitHub
* **binary/tar**: Downloaded as tar archive and extracted to ~/.local/bin
* **binary/deb**: Downloaded as .deb package and installed via dpkg
* **special**: Custom installation logic (mise self-install, jmc with prompt, lazyvim git clone)
