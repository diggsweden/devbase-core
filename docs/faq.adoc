= FAQ

== General

=== What does this install?

See link:tools-matrix.adoc[Tools Matrix] - ~90+ development tools.

=== Which Ubuntu versions does it support?

24.04 LTS or newer. WSL2 or native.

=== Can I run this multiple times?

Yes. One-time backs up configs, preserves SSH keys and git settings, respects numbered config files (10-99).

=== How often should I run updates?

Monthly or as needed. Run `./setup.sh` to update everything.

=== Can I uninstall everything?

No uninstaller provided for now.

=== How do I migrate softly from my old existing user on my system?

Just create a new user, and start using that, slowly migrating what you need.

[source,bash]
----
sudo adduser <newuser>
sudo usermod -aG sudo <newuser>
----

NOTE: If on WSL, we also can keep the old default user, but set a new default

[source,bash]
----

sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf

# Set the default user when launching a distribution with WSL.
[user]
default=<newuser>

# Shutdown WSL and restart to take effect
wsl --shutdown
----

== Customization

=== Does the install create lots of custom shortcuts and aliases?

No, everything is as standard as can be.
There are a few small cases, like alt+y in fish shell.
These are documented in the usage docs.

=== How do themes work on WSL?

Run devbase-theme and find out

=== How do I personalize without losing changes on update?

Add your customizations to separate files: `~/.config/fish/conf.d/10-personal.fish`

Devbase provides 00-09 system files. User files 10-99 won't be overwritten since they don't exist in the template.

=== Can I skip certain components?

No. The installer runs all components. Fork and modify if you need selective installation.

For organization-specific customization, see link:customization.adoc[Custom Configuration].

=== Is this a distro?

No. This is a bootstrap script - not a package manager, not a CLI tool, maybe it could be called a dotfiles + script.

== Operations

=== How do I update everything?

[source,bash]
----

cd devbase-core
git pull --rebase
./setup.sh  # Safe to run multiple times
----

=== How do I switch tool versions?

[source,bash]
----
mise global python@3.11 # System-wide
mise list              # Show installed versions
----

=== How do I check my installation?

[source,bash]
----
just devbase-install-verify # After installation, and reboot, from the devbase-core dir
cat ~/.config/devbase/version  # Installation metadata
which fish                     # Verify shell
mise doctor                    # Check mise setup
----

== Technical

=== Where are tools installed?

- System packages: `/usr/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/`
- User tools: `~/.local/bin/`
- Language versions: `~/.local/share/mise/`
- Configurations: `~/.config/`

=== Which shell is set as default?

Fish for interactive shells. Fall back to bash with: `bash`.

=== How do I see what's happening during installation?

Most output is shown in the terminal. Use `DEBUG=1 ./setup.sh` for additional details.

=== What's the difference between mise and asdf?

mise is a Rust rewrite of asdf with better performance, additional backends (aqua, ubi), and improved security. 

=== Why Podman instead of Docker?

Rootless by default, no daemon, Docker-compatible.
