= Editor Setup

== VS Code

=== WSL Users - Important

VS Code extensions on WSL are installed in the *VS Code Server* (`~/.vscode-server`), which is created when you first connect from Windows VS Code using the Remote-WSL extension.

DevBase setup handles this automatically:

1. **During setup**: If Remote-WSL extension is installed, setup offers to automatically launch VS Code to create vscode-server
2. **If you decline or it fails**: Setup provides step-by-step instructions for your specific user
3. **After vscode-server is created**: Re-run setup to install extensions

==== Per-User Setup

Each WSL user (including when using `su -l username`) needs their own vscode-server:

[source,bash]
----
# Connect from WSL as specific user
wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u username
/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ VS\ Code/bin/code .

# Or let DevBase setup handle it automatically during installation
----

The setup script detects your current user and provides tailored instructions.

=== Extensions

Extensions installed automatically if VS Code detected:
- GitLens
- EditorConfig
- Prettier
- ESLint
- Shellcheck
- YAML
- Docker
- Remote Development

Settings applied: `.config/Code/User/settings.json`

== Neovim

DevBase installs LazyVim starter configuration with:
- LSP support
- Treesitter syntax
- Everforest theme (matches terminal theme)
- Leader key: `space`

Config: `~/.config/nvim/`

Add personal configs to:
- `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` - Custom plugin configurations
- `~/.config/nvim/after/` - Personal overrides

See link:https://www.lazyvim.org/configuration[LazyVim documentation] for customization options.

== IntelliJ IDEA

Import code styles from devbase-core installation directory:
- Java: `.config/devtools/formatting/java/eclipse-java-google-style.xml`
- Checkstyle: `.config/devtools/linting/java/google_checks.xml`

Settings → Editor → Code Style → Import Scheme

These files are copied to `~/.config/devtools/` during installation.

== Common Issues

=== VS Code can't find tools
Add to settings.json:
[source,json]
----
"terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
  "fish": {
    "path": "/usr/bin/fish"
  }
}
----

=== Neovim plugins not loading
[source,bash]
----
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim
nvim --headless "+Lazy! sync" +qa
----
