== Getting Started

=== Installation Modes

DevBase works in two modes:

* *Base Mode (Default)* - Clone and run `./setup.sh`. No additional configuration needed. Gets you a complete development environment with sensible defaults.
* *Custom Mode* - Add a `devbase-custom-config/` directory for overlaying custom settings. See link:customization.adoc[Custom Configuration].
